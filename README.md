# Plox

Plox is the Python implementation of the compiler for the Lox programming
language from Robert Nystrom's book called "Crafting Interpreters".

## Getting Started

The project is developed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). It uses
pre-commit hooks and popular automation tools to improve project management
(e.g. `black` for formatting, `mypy` for static type-checking, etc).

To install the poetry package as a virtual environment, run:

`$ poetry install`

When you first clone the repository to your local machine, you *must* install
the pre-commit hooks so that all the automation checks run on `git commit`. You
can do so by running:

`$ poetry run pre-commit install`
